          <h2 className="mb-5 text-center xl:text-4xl text-2xl font-medium">THE HISTORY OF BRABUS</h2>
          <p className="max-w-4xl mx-auto xl:text-lg text-sm px-5">
            <br />
            <strong className="mr-2">Genesis (1977-1984)</strong>
            Founded in 1977 by Bodo Buschmann, BRABUS emerged as a tuning company in Bottrop, Germany. The name &quot;BRABUS&quot; is derived from the first three characters of Bodo Buschmann&apos;s name and the city of Bottrop. The company started its
            journey by specializing in the maintenance and enhancement of high-performance Mercedes-Benz vehicles. The commitment to precision and performance quickly gained attention, laying the foundation for what would become a global
            automotive phenomenon.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong className="mr-2">The Birth of BRABUS (1984-1990)</strong>
            In 1984, BRABUS celebrated a significant milestone with the introduction of the BRABUS 190, based on the Mercedes 190 E 3.2. This marked the beginning of BRABUS&apos; transformation into a premier tuning company, elevating the
            performance of Mercedes-Benz cars to unprecedented levels. The BRABUS 190 showcased the company&apos;s dedication to pushing the boundaries of automotive engineering.

            <br />
            <strong className="mr-2">Power and Innovation (1990s)</strong>
            As the 1990s unfolded, BRABUS solidified its reputation for combining luxury with extreme power. The BRABUS E V12, based on the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, made waves as the world&apos;s fastest sedan in 1996, reaching a top speed of 330
            km/h. This era saw the introduction of the BRABUS V12 engines, showcasing the company&apos;s prowess in creating high-performance powertrains.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong className="mr-2">Beyond Boundaries (2000s)</strong>
            Entering the new millennium, BRABUS expanded its portfolio beyond Mercedes-Benz, offering tuning solutions for other luxury brands such as Maybach and Smart. The BRABUS ROCKET, based on the Mercedes-Benz CLS, gained
            international acclaim for setting a new top speed record for sedans at 365.7 km/h in 2006. The company&apos;s commitment to innovation and speed reached new heights.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong className="mr-2">Global Recognition (2010s)</strong>
            BRABUS continued to make waves in the automotive world throughout the 2010s. The BRABUS 800 E V12 Cabriolet, based on the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, showcased not only blistering performance but also luxurious craftsmanship. The
            company&apos;s global presence expanded, with BRABUS becoming synonymous with exclusive, high-performance vehicles.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong className="mr-2">Today and Tomorrow</strong>
            In the present day, BRABUS stands as a pinnacle of automotive tuning, with a product range that spans from powerful sedans to opulent SUVs and beyond. The BRABUS ROCKET 900 &quot;ONE OF TEN&quot; unveiled in 2019, epitomizes the
            company&apos;s commitment to pushing the limits of performance and exclusivity.
            <br />
            <br />
            As BRABUS continues to evolve, the legacy of Bodo Buschmann lives on, driving the company to explore new frontiers in automotive tuning. With an unwavering dedication to power, precision, and luxury, BRABUS remains at the
            forefront of the high-performance tuning industry, setting the standard for enthusiasts and connoisseurs worldwide.
